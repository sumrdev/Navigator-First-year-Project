# Map of Denmark

First year project at ITU. 

Run the app.jar with     
```bash
java -Xms6g -Xmx6g -jar app.jar
```
If you want to run the source code you can type
```bash
gradle run
```
in the root folder of the project.

We have also included a bat file that runs it for you!

If you have an 8 gig ram computer you might have some issues running the program, but when we tried it on our 8 gig machines - it worked fine :)
